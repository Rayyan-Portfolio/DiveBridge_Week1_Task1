## 📑 How I Used HTML

I used **HTML** to build the content and structure of the website across various semantic sections, ensuring that each part of the portfolio is clearly defined and easy to navigate:

### 1. **Header and Navigation**
- Built using `<header>` and `<nav>`.
- Contains a logo (`port1.png`), a horizontal menu for desktop, and a responsive mobile menu icon.
- Menu items link to different sections using anchor tags and `id`s.

### 2. **Home Section**
- Introduces the site and includes a personal photo (`pic1.jpg`) alongside a short bio.
- Structured using a `<section>` tag and flexbox layout.

### 3. **Skills Section**
- Describes my core skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, UI/UX, and server management.
- Includes a relevant image (`skills.jpg`) placed beside the text.

### 4. **About Section**
- Offers more insight into my development approach, with focus on responsiveness and interactivity.
- Styled with supporting image (`pic2.png`).

### 5. **Personal Statement Section**
- Contains a written reflection of my personal goals, interests, and inspiration behind pursuing tech.
- Text-focused with centered layout for clarity and readability.

### 6. **Contact Section**
- Includes a clean contact form with:
  - Text inputs for name, email, and subject
  - A message box using `<textarea>`
  - A styled button for form submission
- (Note: This is visual only—no form functionality yet.)

### 7. **Footer**
- Includes social media links styled with **Font Awesome** icons.
- Simple copyright.

## 📱 Responsiveness

- The site is built using **flexbox** and **media queries** to ensure optimal viewing on all screen sizes.
- The **mobile menu** toggles visibility using JavaScript.
- Layouts and images scale effectively on phones, tablets, and desktops.
